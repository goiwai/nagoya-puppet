# Evaluation algorithm
#  - possible values are:
#    1) it.grid.storm.authz.path.model.PathAuthzAlgBestMatch
#       - To determine if a request succeeds, the algorithm process 
#         the ACE entries in a computed order. Only ACEs which have 
#         a "local group" that matches the subject requester are considered.
#         The order of ACE is defined on the base of distance from StFN 
#         targetted and the Path specified within the ACE. Each ACE is 
#         processed until all of the bits of the requester's access have 
#         been checked. The result will be:
#         - NOT_APPLICABLE if there are no ACE matching with the requester.
#         - INDETERMINATE if there is at least one bit not checked.
#         - DENY if there is at least one bit DENIED for the requestor
#         - PERMIT if all the bits are PERMIT
